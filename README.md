ZILU has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 x64. It should work on other Linux platfroms, but we have not tested yet.

## ZILU Installation on local computer
#### pre-requirement (most of the package can be installed with apt-get on Ubuntu)
- apt-get install git cmake flex bison clang z3 libz3-dev libgsl0-dev
	- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
	- [cmake](https://cmake.org/) version 2.8 or later
	- [flex](https://github.com/westes/flex) version 2.6.1 or later
	- [bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) version 2.6.0 or later
	- [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)
	- [z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) is applied to check the smt-constraints generated by KLEE.
	- [GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) This library is used to solve equations in our project. 
<!---
	- apt-get install z3 libz3-dev
	- or from source:
```
	git clone https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3.git
	cd z3
	python contrib/cmake/bootstrap.py create
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../
	make -j
	sudo make install
```
	- apt-get install libgsl0-dev
--->
- "make" and otherLLVM essential building tools, you can add if needed
- [KLEE](https://klee.github.io/) only test llvm2.9 yet, so try to build KLEE by [build-llvm29](http://klee.github.io/releases/docs/v1.3.0/build-llvm29/). 
	- If you can not build KLEE with the above instruction, maybe you can refer to 
		- [link1](http://blog.opensecurityresearch.com/2014/07)
		- [link2](http://klee-dev.keeda.stanford.narkive.com/RqzseDmo/problems-when-compiling-klee-runtime).


#### Get the latest zilu
```
git clone https://github.com/lijiaying/zilu.git
cd zilu
```

#### Patch KLEE source code
This modification aims at generating smt2 file for each path condition.
We mainly add new method calls **``klee_fail && klee_pass''**, as we would like to output the path condition to files in these method calls.

- klee.6609a03.patch is the patch file. It should be applied to KLEE with commit signature 6609a03e68bf551f433ddd0fd8cf64a8683ee2ee, the short SHA: 6609a03.
- Change to Klee with commit 6609a03. 
	- git checkout 6609a03
- Apply the patch 
	- git apply ${zilu-home}/klee.6609a03.patch
- Rebuild and install the patched KLEE. 
	- make ENABLE\_OPTIMIZED=1
	- sudo make install
- After patching KLEE, it is OK that several tests of KLEE might be failed. Just ignore them as long as the _make_ return 0.

<!---
- for the latest klee version (up to July 16th, 2017), we also offer a patch as klee.patch
	- cd klee-project-home
	- git apply ${zilu-home}/klee.patch
	- make ENABLE_OPTIMIZED=1
	- sudo make install
--->


#### Test ZILU
```
./run benchmark/03.cfg
```

### Try *zilu* from docker hub
This is not supported for now. As klee has updated its build support platform from llvm-2.9 to llvm-3.4. We will update this in a few months.
```
docker pull lijiaying/zilu
```
